# Volutime
A volume control app that allows you to time your listening sessions so you know when to stop listening to music to prevent ear damage.

## Development
The application was developed using Android Studio with APK 26. It was tested using the Nexus 5 emulator with APK 26.
The application uses the [Circular Seek Bar](https://github.com/devadvance/circularseekbar "Circular Seek Bar by devadvance") from devadvance for the time circle.

## Features
The application has the following features:
- Allows you to find the time you can listen at for a certain volume and vice versa (dependant locking).
- Allows you to see if the time you want works for a preferred volume and vice versa (independent locking).
- Reset button to reset a session
- Profile page
- Statistics page of all past sessions
- Settings page
- Pause and Play music

## Starting a Session
To start a session, set a time and/or volume and play your music. A notification will be sent when a session has started, when you have less than 15 minutes left and when the session has ended.

*The application is currently in the prototyping and development phase.*
